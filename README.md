# Iris Dataset Classification

This project applies different machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.  

## Algorithms Used
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Iris Dataset**.  
Source: [Kaggle - Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)  

## Results
The models were trained and tested to evaluate their performance in predicting the correct flower species.
