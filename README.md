# Naive-Bayes-SVM-Classification

This Jupyter Notebook includes analysis and classification of the Iris dataset.  
I used data visualization techniques with seaborn and matplotlib to explore the dataset,  
and applied both Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to predict flower species.  
The notebook also includes model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
